Python is one of the most popular, flexible programming languages today. You can use it for everything from basic scripting to machine learning.

In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, we'll learn Python fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Then we'll quickly ramp up to data structures.

## Certification Overview

In this certification, you will cover the following key areas:

1. **Python Fundamentals:**
   - Variables
   - Loops
   - Conditionals
   - Functions


## Getting Started

To get started with the certification, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/scientific-computing-certification.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository:

    ```bash
    cd scientific-computing-certification
    ```

3. Follow the course material and exercises in the provided directories.

## Certification Structure

The certification is structured as follows:

- **01_learn-string-manipulation-by-building-a-cipher:**
  - Basic concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.

- **02_Luhn-algorithm:**
  - The Luhn Algorithm is widely used for error-checking in various applications, such as verifying credit card numbers. Upon building this project, we'll gain experience working with numerical computations and string manipulation.

- **03_Expense-tracker:**
  - In this project, we'll explore the power of Lambda Functions by creating an expense tracker. The resulting app will demonstrate how we can use Lambda Functions for efficient, streamlined operations.

- **04_Case-convertor:**
  - List Comprehension is a way to construct a new Python list from an iterable types: lists, tuples, and strings. All without using a for loop or the `.append()` list method. In this project, we'll write a program that takes a string formatted in Camel Case or Pascal Case, then converts it into Snake Case.

- **05_Password-generator:**
  - In this project, we'll learn how to import modules from the Python standard library. we'll also learn how to use Regular Expressions by building our own password generator program.

- **06_Shortest-path-algorithm:**
  - In this project, we'll learn how to use functions, loops, conditional statements, and dictionary comprehensions to implement a Shortest Path algorithm.

- **07_Tower-of-hanoi:**
  - In this we'll start with a loop-based approach to solving the tower of Hanoi mathematical puzzle. Then we'll learn how to implement a recursive solution.

- **08_Merge-sort:**
  - we'll learn how to interact with data structures by sorting a list of random numbers using the Merge Sort Algorithm.

- **09_Sudoku-Solver:**
  - In this Sudoku Solver project, you'll learn how to use classes and objects to build a Sudoku grid and to solve a Sudoku puzzle.

- **10_Binary-search-tree:**
  - In this project, we'll learn how to construct your own BST and perform an in-order traversal. 




## Certification Completion

Upon completing the certification, one should have a strong foundation in scientific computing with Python. Feel free to explore additional resources, work on practical projects, and continue your learning journey in the fascinating field of Python for scientific applications.

Python is one of the most popular, flexible programming languages today. You can use it for everything from basic scripting to machine learning.

In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, we'll learn Python fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Then we'll quickly ramp up to complex data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization.

## Certification Overview

In this certification, you will cover the following key areas:

1. **Python Fundamentals:**
   - Variables
   - Loops
   - Conditionals
   - Functions

2. **Advanced Python:**
   - Complex Data Structures
   - Networking
   - Relational Databases

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Introduction to Data Visualization
   - Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Getting Started

To get started with the certification, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/scientific-computing-certification.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository:

    ```bash
    cd scientific-computing-certification
    ```

3. Follow the course material and exercises in the provided directories.

## Certification Structure

The certification is structured as follows:

- **01_learn-string-manipulation-by-building-a-cipher:**
  - Basic concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.

- **02_Luhn-algorithm:**
  - The Luhn Algorithm is widely used for error-checking in various applications, such as verifying credit card numbers. Upon building this project, we'll gain experience working with numerical computations and string manipulation.



## Certification Completion

Upon completing the certification, one should have a strong foundation in scientific computing with Python. Feel free to explore additional resources, work on practical projects, and continue your learning journey in the fascinating field of Python for scientific applications.
